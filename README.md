# Endless Desert

This game was made in Java over the course of one month, development starting the day it was conceived on November 28, 2014, and concluding the day it was released on December 28, 2014. Most of this time was spent trying to wrap my brain around the 3D projection code I was learning (and implementing at the same time), and also trying to make the game world infinite. My new year's resolution is, of course, to understand what I'm making before I start making something.
